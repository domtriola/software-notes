## Overview

Bash is a Unix Shell and command language. It is a command processor that you can interact with by entering commands in the terminal. You can also run commands via a shell script.

## Getting Started

[Reference Manual](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html)

* To run commands open up a terminal (for almost any Unix-like system)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ^ use a shebang at the top of a script to tell the system what language to use
# to execute the script

# Make a script executable to run it
chmod 0700 script.sh

# Use the `man` command for the manual on any command (including man)
man man
```
